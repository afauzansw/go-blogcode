## About Project

This is my first golang project. Transforming from Laravel with its very pampering artisan. This project is my practice to make CRUD in golang. I took a case study on blogger which is only available for post, tag, and publisher management.



## Feature

- Management post
- Management tag
- Management publisher
- Reading page article
